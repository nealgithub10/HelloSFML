00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.319
This is a great lesson which no university
taught me no book taught me but that one

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.349
person that institution taught me such a
bigger lesson so I thought of sharing

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.800
with you how to manage Success most
importantly the failure i had to repeated a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.130
number of times I don't mind repeating
that one incident that incident for me

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.800
is a university education

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.880
I'm not ready anywhere i have a so far i
have gone around the orbit 71 times around

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.489
the Sun i have not gone through any
education such a beautiful education i

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.690
got in seven 1979 1980 . i thought of
sharing with you on this occasion it is

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.940
like this 1979 august 17th  we were
ready for launch of the satellite launch

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.140
vehicle with 44 subsystem and thousands
of thousands of the components it was

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.810
built in Vikram Sarabhai Space Center and
at that time professor Satish dhawan was the Chairman

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.200
space Commission and
is also Space Center and he gave me the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.259
task 1973 to build a satellite launch
vehicle to put a satellite in the orbit

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.250
1973 he gave me this task in 79 we
were ready thousands of engineers ten

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.380
thousands of workers and staff they all
work together then we moved that satellite that

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.070
satellite launch vehicle from vikram
Sarabhai Space Center to the now

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.740
Satish dhawan Space Center at sriharikota
 those so the launch vehicle was

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.460
was in the launchpad and that  days 17th August 1979 and I am

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.469
the mission director project director
and you're all the control center and

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.959
computer takes over at t-minus eight minutes
computer take over it was very difficult

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:11.440
for me as a mission director to check
hundreds of parameters so it has to be

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.480
checked computer we handover the whole
launch of the Rocket system system to the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.380
computer so when t-minus eight minutes came    
i handed over to the computer for the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.180
launch on 17

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.060
august seven 1979 and thousands of
people are waiting for the launch

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.170
mission centers and they're working
throughout the country and some down

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.410
train stations exactly at T-minus eight
minutes computer tookover and then at

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.319
t-minus four minutes computer put a
hault it says don't launch so we're

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:53.200
all because at that time the whole
rocket system alive and everybody is a

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.720
closed system propallent system electronic
system all around ready to launch

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.090
computer says don't launch at t-minus
four minutes that immediately a computer

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.819
printout comes out there is some problem
in the second stage control system there

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:18.280
is a leakage so you don't launch behind me there
are number of experts six -seven experts my

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.370
experts ten years twenty years  experienced people
i talk to them and they are there

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.870
computers to find out what happened and
they tell me within a within a minute

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.639
they say there's a problem in the second
state control system and we cannot

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:40.060
launch computer says but we believe as experts 
that the ignitor  that is

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.329
oxidizer sufficiently more there even
though there is a leakage in system you can

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.700
launch they asked me to launch that is i
can say the computer shut off the

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.849
computer I can manually launch the
rocket system

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.189
I took that i discussed with my experts I
believed in them i agree with them and

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:02.450
responsible for it

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.459
I immediately put the rocket in the
manual mode so rocket took off hundred

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:13.129
seconds beautiful launch and the rocket
first stage did it's job its a

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:19.100
four stage rocket system then the
second stage took off with in a minute

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.770
within a second it recorded to spin that
means which we study is control rocket

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.020
system by guidance system but it was
going to spin I knew I lost the rocket

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.460
system within few seconds instead of
putting the satellite into orbit the

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.240
whole system went to Bayofbengal so it was
a failure and then how do you handle a

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.910
failure is very important for the
entrepreneurs life is not so simple is a

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:53.240
we have to handle the failures with stout
heart my chairman with that is that

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.979
professor Satish dhawan

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:01.400
exactly 6 :30 i was very tired of
continuously working he come to my room

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.740
you join me for a press conference on
that day press call in the morning there is a

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.710
press conference hundreds of  Press
reporters media people have assembled

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.349
just Professor Satish Dhawan told
me I am going to handle the press

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:19.190
conference

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:25.520
you're going to come with me he took
me there was a press the national press

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.740
international press they asked lot of questions how can he put 20 cores in

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.539
Bayofbengal one guy asked and like
that so many serious questions after

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.430
all people will ask us questions people's money
so like that number of questions were

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:47.419
there and professor Satish Dhawan said yes it's a
failure first time we launched we have

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:54.020
gained a lot of system and definitely we
will succeed i will give all the support ,

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.479
technologies and give the whole supposed
to my scientist i will be will succeed

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.900
in a year's time he said friends did you
observe what happened there

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.050
I am the mission director i am the
project director I have failed the mission

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:18.150
with me 5,000 people worked but chairman
Indian space research organisation he

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.000
take the responsibility the failure he
completely switched my  failure to his

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.720
failure

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.720
this is the leadership quality

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:44.840
ex-exactly after one year that is eighteenth 
july 1980 we go to the launch pad  and

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:51.020
countdown starts t-minus eight minutes  
i handover to the computer computer checks

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:58.400
out first stage you need it for it initiates the  rocket system first stage gives

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.260
the required velocity second stage gives
the required velocity third state gives

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.610
the required velocity and four stage
required the escape velocity for

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.900
to put the satellite in the orbit, i am
seeing  in front of me what is

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.300
performance taking place i took the
micros with the mic announce all the

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.950
station here is your mission director
the satellite is into orbit and we

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.600
congratulate you I told them no that's
not the important that's one of the

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:33.229
important things happen but after 30
minutes Satish dhawan called me

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:40.400
go to the press conference you conduct the press
conference he said can you see the

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:46.340
significance failure he took it and success  he gave me to my team just a

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.340
great lesson is a great lesson

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.100
yeah

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:01.200
this is a great lesson which no 
university taught me

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:07.440
no book taught me but that one person
that institution that taught me such a
